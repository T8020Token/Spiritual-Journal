      scripture: [
        "Psalm 103:13 - As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him.",
        "2 Corinthians 6:18 - I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.",
        "Romans 8:15 - You did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, Abba, Father!",
        "1 John 3:1 - See how great a love the Father has given us, that we would be called children of God; and in fact we are!",
        "Isaiah 30:18 - Yet the Lord longs to be gracious to you; therefore He will rise up to show you compassion...",
        "Isaiah 49:15-16 - Can a mother forget her nursing child? ... Yet I will not forget you. See, I have engraved you on the palms of My hands."
      ],
      devotional: "In the beginning—before there was pain, before sin broke the earth—there was a Father. Yahweh wasn’t distant. He walked with Adam in the cool of the day... He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world... You were made to walk with your Father again. Not just as a servant. Not as a stranger. But as a son, a daughter, fully adopted into a family sealed by eternal love.",
      reflection: [
        "Have you seen Yahweh as a harsh judge, or as a compassionate Father?",
        "Are you living like a slave trying to earn love, or a child already embraced by it?"

      scripture: [
        "2 Corinthians 5:19 - God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them...",
        "Romans 5:8 - But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.",
        "Isaiah 53:5 - He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities...",
        "John 15:13 - Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for his friends.",
        "1 Peter 3:18 - For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God...",
        "Philippians 2:8 - He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross."
      ],
      devotional: "There is no cross without a covenant. There is no forgiveness without blood... Yeshua is not some side character in God’s plan. He is the plan. He is Yahweh in flesh, come not just to preach or to heal, but to bleed—to die in our place... He’d rather die than live without you.",
      reflection: [
        "Have you ever truly received the cross as personal?",
